## Details

- Approx. completion time: **4 hours**
- Deliverables: **6 HTML files, 6 CSS files, 6 Javascript files**

Complete these series of six little challenges for learning Javascript syntax. They grow in complexity and difficulty as you progress through them.

### 1. Letter looper

**[▸ View the demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwK-DLrxcEo)**

Create a function in Javascript that will request the user enter a letter and write that letter out ten times.

The final output should look like this:

```
a
a
a
a
a
a
a
a
a
a
```

### 2. Letter looper triangle

**[▸ View the demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5CgQbyRm2w)**

Take the letter looper a step further by creating a triangle out of the letters: line 1 should have 1 copy, line 2 should have 2 copies, all the way to the 10th line having 10 copies of the letter.

The final output should match this:

```
a
aa
aaa
aaaa
aaaaa
aaaaaa
aaaaaaa
aaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaa
```

### 3. Hello, Person

**[▸ View the demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CvgZPSHDLw)**

Create a small application that shows a text form field to the user, they can enter their name, press a button, and the application will write: “Hello, Thomas.” (or whatever their name is).

The final output should look like this:

```
Hello, Thomas.
```

### 4. Name judger

**[▸ View the demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il_K6CivGcY)**

Similar to the above application, but instead write out different sayings based on what name they enter.

Come up with some sort of name judging logic and display a message for different conditions. The logic could be how many letters long it is, or what letter it starts with, or the actual name itself.

The final output should look like these examples:

```
Whoa, your name is really short, Fe.
```

```
My name starts with a “T” too, Tamara.
```

```
Edith is a really great name!
```

### 5. Phrasal template word game

**[▸ View the demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usDh0jWJ_2U)**

Create a form that accepts a bunch of words, like verbs, nouns, etc. Those words will be placed into a template to generate a fun story, like *Mad Libs*.

### 6. Interactive story

**[▸ View the demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsAtD-Fdp1U)**

Create a interactive multiple choice story, like *Choose Your Own Adventure*. Each answered question branches the story in a different direction.
